# KFlowEX

`KFlowEX` is the enhanced version of `KFlow` which aims to provide the basic dependence management and node execution functionalities. But in production, it's better to provide a new kind of tools that can make life easier. `KFlowEX` provices some abstraction and encapsulation above `KFlow` like: 
- Use `Description` method rather than use `Name` and `Dependence` method.
- Support middleware for node and adding operation.

More usage can be found in the test case.
